The clean and shiny search bar that does what UISearchBar does only with dirty hacks. This search bar class is designed to overcome the customization limits of UISearchBar. The difference here is that this class does not inherit UISearchBar but composes a new UIView object by using a UITextField that is much easier to use. The limits of the search bar are as follows:

- no clean way to left align the placeholder
- the cancel button is hard to taylor to your needs
- generally the appearance is not customizable (e.g. the font of the text)
- there are some strange behaviours when you set a custom background image

Since I use a UITextField these restrictions do not apply.

## Example

The repo includes an example project. It shows shows different use cases of the searchbar. To run it, clone the repo and run `pod install` from the Example directory first. The following images show some of these use cases:

<caption align="bottom">The inner text field supports the new iOS 10 'textContentMode'. Here it re-uses the address the user searched in Apple Maps.</caption>
